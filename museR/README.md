# museR

MuseR parses music represented in the .krn format. You can read more about this format [here](http://www.humdrum.org/guide/ch02/) or [here](https://csml.som.ohio-state.edu/Humdrum/representations/kern.html). 

Using the import_xml_files.sh, museR can also parse the MusicXML format. An instalation of [Humdrum](https://github.com/kroger/humdrum) is required. This program converts the MusicXML files into .krn format.
