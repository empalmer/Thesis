## My Thesis Repo

I'm going to continue working on this on the 2nd when I get back from break. I'm going to continue revising my first chapter, especially adding more stats stuff. I wasnt able to make much progress before I left for break since our meeting on Thursday. A lot of the articles I was trying to access needed permissions, and I'm not on campus to be able to access them. Currently I've been trying to get words down, and I know there is a lot that sounds weird. If a sentence doesnt make sense at all, I probably know, and will change it later. I've currently been reading a lot on feature selection. I will add to those sections over break. 

Over break, I will work on: 

- Scanning all music and converting into data frames. Double checking for errors in scanned and converted forms.
- Coding of all features!
- Revising first chapter
- Start writing second chapter
