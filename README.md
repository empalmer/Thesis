## My Thesis Repo

I'm still working on editing my first chapter. The first time I write sentences down they sound really weird and silly so I'm going through several drafting phases. I'm trying to change the perspective from author to concept. I think I'm going to put a lot of the description about what previous research did for features in the section where I talk about my features. I'm also still working on adding to the Background and Variable Selection section.  

Over break, I will work on: 

- Scanning all music and converting into data frames. Double checking for errors in scanned and converted forms.
- Coding of all features!
- Revising first chapter
- Start writing second chapter
