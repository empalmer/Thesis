# Model Fit

## Model Fit - Bach/Mendelssohn

#### Logistic Regression

A 5-fold cross-validated lasso logistic model was fit. The below graph shows the misclassification rate for different values of log(lambda). As the log(lambda) increases, the coefficients of each of the features start approaching zero. They do this at differnt times and rates. A 5-fold crossvalidation fit found that log(lambda) = -  A model fit using the lambda value with the minimum missclassifcation rate resulted in a miss-classification rate of 0.117. 
We see that the density features stayed in the longest.

#### LDA
For linear discriminant analysis, we have a 5-fold cross validated MSE of 0.13.Most commonly our models incorrectly predict Mendelssohn songs to be composed by Bach. 

#### Naive Bayes
A naive model was fit and resulted a miss-classification rate of 0.07

#### KNN

A K-Nearest Neighbors classifier was fit, with $K$ chosen to be 1 from 5-fold cross validation. This resulted in a miss-classification rate of .22

## Model fit Felix/Fanny

It there seems like there is not enough data to have a stable misclassification rate for different choices of fold. 

#### Logistic regression
When a logistic classifier was fit, we got an average miss-classification rate of 0.35. We see that the density features and fifth scale degree stayed in the longest.

#### Naive Bayes

A naive Bayes model was fit and the 5-fold miss-classification rate averaged between .4 and .5.

#### LDA
An LDA model was fit and predicts correctly about 50/50

#### knn
With K=8, the missclassification rate was about .43

## Predictions for Disputed pieces: 

Since we have such high missclassification rates, the following predictions are likely not accurate. 

- Logistic: Predicts Op 8 no 2 and 12 to be written by Felix. 
- Naive Bayes: Predicted all four as written by Fanny. 
- knn: Predicted Op 8 no 12 to be written by Felix.
- LDA: Predicted Op9 no 12 to be written by Felix.
