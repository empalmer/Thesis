\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Music often has subjective summary ``statistics'' throughout music
literature and everyday conversation. For example we talk about
Beethoven's Symphony 9 (think ode to joy) as ``majestic, powerful,
fateful, expertly written, etc'', music critics go more in depth to talk
about the performance and reception, and those with a musical background
might go into more description into the actual music compared to the
emotional affect.

What if one wanted to compare Beethoven to Bach? One might say that
Beethoven was a classical composer, whereas Bach was a baroque composer.
What exactly to those classifiers mean? Sure, it is very well documented
the years each composer was active in, and that there were large changes
in the popular aspects of classical music. Even the untrained ear can
distinguish differences between Bach and Beethoven. What exactly is the
difference that one can hear? Does Bach follow counterpoint rules more
exactly? What ways can we empirically differentiate those two composers?
How about Mozart and Saliery who were contemporaries? While those
familiar with classical music can spot the differences between the two
composers, it is more difficult for the untrained ear or eye to spot the
differences.

What if we had a piece and didn't know who wrote it? What features are
inherent in a composers style that would allow us to identify the true
composer?

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

\subsection{Federalist Papers}\label{federalist-papers}

Text classification has recently become a large field. One of the
earliest instances of text classification was on the Federalist
papers.(Mosteller \& Wallace, 1964). The famous Federalist Papers were
written under the pen name `Publius'. There are several disputed papers
attributed to James Madison or Alexander Hamilton. Historians have often
examined the papers using styles of previously known writings of Madison
and Hamilton. () Using the frequency of words such as and `by', `from',
and `upon' Mosteller and Wallace trained the writings on a set of pieces
of each. These unconscious indicators were able to differentiate between
the two writers, and when a model was trained (using \ldots{}. ), the
model was able to identify the author of the disputed paper.

\subsection{Music}\label{music}

Almost any piece by any composer has already been thoroughly examined by
music historians. (Paragraph about things that music historians talk
about when analyzing music. find sources for this. )

The human eye, no matter how well trained in music, has an extremely
hard time noticing small features throughout a piece. Even if one has a
feature in mind, would one want to count the number of times an author
used the word `as' in a 500 page book? Would one trust that count to be
accurate? Say one composer was very fond of middle C, and consistently
used it slightly more than other composers. Unless the use of C was
extreme, likely breaking rules of counterpoint and making odd melodic
and harmonic choices, a human might not be able to catch this
characteristic. Writing has certain rules of grammar, that one would
expect all published writers to mostly follow. Writers would likely
never have the word `as' written twice in a row. Similarly, classical
music has rules and conventions. Counterpoint (described in Chapter 2),
melody, and characteristics of the instrument composed for constrict a
composer.

How can one find similar unconscious features comparable to word
frequency for a composer? Some have analyzed these features in audio
format (MIDI) to distinguish certain genres of music. (De Le√≥n \&
Inesta, 2003) They used self-organizing neural maps to classify music as
either jazz or classical. In this paper we look at music in sheet music
form. Sheet music is how composers write the music, and sheet music
contains all the the information displayed clearly that a recording
might not be obvious.

We then come to an interesting problem regarding extracting information
from sheet music. Writing such as in the federalist papers is one word
then the next, read left to right line by line, one word at a time.
However music is read in a variety of ways. It can be read left to right
note by note, but it can also be read vertically as the harmony, or the
notes played together. Also in a piece with several instruments, the
above happens at the same time for each instrument. There are also
aspects that take place over large sections, such as phrasing, or
cadencial patterns. There are rules of counterpoint that are followed
throughout the entire piece. How then do we detect what features are
those of rules and practices of classical music, and where the
creativeness and individuality of a composer happens?

Most of the musical stylometry papers have focused on composers in the
Renaissance, baroque and classical period. The Mendelssohns were
composing in the Romantic period. This choice might be because composers
in earlier eras had less ``expressive'' allowances for their composing,
thus making features easier.

\subsection{Previous choices of
features}\label{previous-choices-of-features}

Deciding on and extracting features of music is the first step to
analysis. Depending on the characteristics of the composer and time
period, different features would be useful. Often, features are
extracted en masse and then work is done later to determine which
features are important or useful in identifying style.

Work by Backer and Kranenburg (Backer \& Kranenburg, 2005) analyzed the
music of Bach, Handel, Telemann, Mozart and Haydn. Additionally they
compared J.S. Bach, W.F. Bach and J.L Krebs in an attempt to classify
BWV 534. They use overlapping windowing over each entire composition to
produce more data, and avoid issues of dimensionality (?). They chose a
window of 30 bars to create a high enough number of fragments per piece
and a low enough variance of the feature values between fragments. They
chose to extract 20 features. They extracted information regarding the
``stability'' computed by dividing the standard deviation of the lengths
of the fragment by the mean length of the fragments. It is normalized in
this way to be comparable over differing time signatures. They also
found the fraction of the score that consisted of dissonant sororities,
as well as the fraction of bars that begin with a dissonant sonority.
Next they computed the entropy of the probability of occurrence of ways
of thinking about chords; chords are the same no matter what scale
degree they are on, and distinguishing chords differently. Next the
entropy was calculated given the probability of each pitch in the score.
Entropy was calculated by \(-\sum_{i = 1}^{N}p_i\log{p_i}\) where
\(p_i\) is the probability of occurrence, and \(N\) is the total number.
Next they the average number of active voices at one time. This
represents the voice density of the piece. Then for every interval, the
duration of that interval was divided by the total duration of all
intervals. Next the total duration of parallel thirds, fourths, and
sixths divided by the total duration of all intervals was measured.
Finally a measure of suspensions was found.

A number of previous papers have focused on Josquin des Prez. This is
likely due to the fact that there is a large training and testing data
set available in easily analyzable format provided by the Josquin
Research Project (citation). In addition there are a number of pieces of
disputed authorship that have been attributed to him. Work by Brinkman
et al. (Brinkman, Shanahan, \& Sapp, n.d.) use machine learning
approaches to evaluate attribution of compositions by des Prez. They
used both high level and low level features. The high level features
were 9-8 suspensions, oblique motion, contrary motion, similar motion
and parallel motion. The low level features were average melodic
entropy, normalized pairwise variability index (?), and note-to-note
transition probabilities.

Work by Speiser and Gupta (Speiser \& Gupta, n.d.) analyzed Josquin and
his contemporaries to attempt to classify unknown works. They extracted
four categories of features, frequencies of individual notes,
frequencies of pairwise interval combinations between each of the
voices, Markov transition matrices for the rhythms of the pieces, and
Markov transition matrices of the pitches in each piece. In total, this
lead to a total of 3000 features. (Help why?)

\subsection{Background on Variable and Feature
Selection}\label{background-on-variable-and-feature-selection}

Especially in research regarding gene expression and text
categorization, data sets have enormous numbers of variables. Here
variable are raw inputs, and features are variables constructed for
input variables (Guyon \& Elisseeff, 2003). There are several variable
selection algorithms that select the ``important'' variables.

Several variable selection algorithms include variable ranking. Variable
ranking uses a score function to assign a score to each input variable.
It is a computationally efficient method and is robust against over
fitting as it introduces bias, but may have less variance. It is
tempting to only include variables that have a high score. However, this
possibly leads to redundancy. In addition, variables that are not
important by themselves can have a significant performance improvement
when considered with other variables.

Will include more after I read more\ldots{}

\subsection{Methods for analysis}\label{methods-for-analysis}

Most of the previous research has needed to do some kind of feature
selection. The whole reason use machine learning is because us humans
cannot detect which features are important and distinguishing.

In a study to identify distinguishing style between Bach, Handel,
Telemann, Mozart, and Haydn, and then subsequently classify the
authorship of BWV 535, the Floating Forward Selection algorithm was used
to extract important features. (Backer \& Kranenburg, 2005) Each
composer in the study was compared via creating comparisons of all
possible class arrangements, ie (Bach)(Handel), (Bach)(Handel,Teleman),
etc. They extracted features for each class arrangement that
distinguished the groups the best. For Bach and not Bach, they created a
decision boundary for the features Diss Part, Par thirds, and stab time
slice. For Bach and others and each individually, they classified via a
k-nearest neighbor classifier. They use decision trees to interpret the
features used in decision making of the different class arrangements. To
determine authorship of BWV 535, they train a quadratic Bayesian
classifier to distinguish J.S. Bach, W.F. Bach and J.L Krebs. They again
compare every possible class arrangement as potential composers.

Brinkman et al. (Brinkman et al., n.d.) used PCa to reduce the
dimensions of the features. Although only two PC's accounted for most of
the variance, they decided to use 5 PC's to account for 85\% of the
variance. They then do binary comparisons of Josquin and other
composers. This resulted in a relatively clear separation between Bach
and Josquin. For Josquin and his contemporaries, the PC's do not do as
well a job of separation. Using results of the principal component
analysis run on all the composers, they train a classifier on all the
composers. First they use a k-nearest neighbor classifier. They use 27
PCs to again account for 85\% of the variance. Next they trained a
support vector machine classifier with a radial kernel. Finally they
used a decision tree to determine which features were important in
discerning the composers.

Speiser and Gupta (Speiser \& Gupta, n.d.) scored each feature by the
mutual information of each features. They then chose the top 50 features
and ran GDA. They then ran PCA to attempt to remove some of the
dependencies associated with musical features. They first fit a Naive
Bayes for classification, but it had a large training error as the
independence assumption does not work well with musical data. Next they
used support vector machines with a Gaussian kernel and GCA learning
algorithms.

\section{Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn}\label{fanny-and-felix-mendelssohn}

Most musical stylometry analysis focuses on music of the Renaissance and
Baroque period, as there are more questions of authorship in that
period. As the Romantic period is much more modern in comparison, there
are many more surviving records of original manuscripts that include the
composer.

Felix Mendelssohn, often considered a prodigy akin to Mozart, was a
prolific composer. Before he was fourteen years old, he had already
written over 100 compositions.

His lesser known sister Fanny Hensel was also a composer of incredible
skill. The two were very close, for many years training and studying
together. In their early education living in Berlin, Felix and Fanny
received the same musical education, first piano lessons by Madam Bigot,
a famous pianist esteemed by Haydn and Beethoven. Beginning in 1818,
Carl Friedrich Zelter, a somewhat removed student of Bach and the most
influential Berlin musician of the time, began to teach them both
composition. In addition to music, the children were tutored by some of
the finest scholars in Berlin in subjects such as languages, history,
and drawing. Goethe himself claimed that Fanny was ``as gifted as
Felix''. (Tillard, 1996)

As Fanny grew up, her father started implying that she should focus her
energy on the domestic sphere of her life. While the fact that she never
became a world famous composer and performer is often attributed to the
gender politics of her time, it is also likely due to her high class.
(Reich, 1991) Especially considering the anti-semetic feelings of the
time, and since the family had recently converted from Judaism to
Christianity, the family did not want any other unusual characteristic
such as a professional female composer to set them further apart from
``polite'' society.

Most of Fanny's available work are Lieder, short pieces of voice
accompanied by piano. They were accepted at the time as the more
feminine, domestic compositions, acceptable for women to compose. Her
brother moved on to more elaborate compositions such as operas and
orchestral concertos. Her father pressured Fanny to remain composing
Lider. (Todd, 2003)
\begin{quote}
``Music will perhaps become his profession, while for you it can and
must only be an ornament, never the root of your being and doing. We may
therefore pardon him some ambition and desire to be acknowledged in a
pursuit which appears very important to him,\ldots{} while it does you
credit that you have always shown yourself good and sensible in these
matters; \ldots{} Remain true to these sentiments and to this line of
conduct; they are feminine, and only what is truly feminine is an
ornament to your sex.''
\end{quote}
Throughout their lives, Felix and Fanny maintained contact through
letters until Fanny's death in 1847 and Felix's death shortly
thereafter. These letters contain many instances of Felix asking for
advice on his compositions (include quote)

Unlike Felix who conducted and performed piano and organ in some of
Berlin's most esteemed concert halls, most of Fanny's performances were
private, only performed in small circles of her friends and family at
intimate parties. Similarly, although she was quite a prolific composer,
under recommendation of her father Abraham Mendelssohn, and to a lesser
extent Felix, Fanny did not publish her work until later in her life. In
1846 after her fathers death and though her brothers disapproval, she
published her first collection of Lieder. Many of Fanny's unpublished
notebooks are in private collections and are inaccessible

However, it is widely speculated (known?) that some of Fanny's work was
published under her brother's name, Especially three pieces each in his
Op 8 and 9 lieder. Famously, when Felix met the Queen of England, she
sang Felix's Lied ``Italien'', and Felix had to admit that in fact, it
was his sister that had written it. In a letter to Felix, Fanny admits:
\begin{quote}
``I have just recently received a letter from Vienna, which contained
basically nothing but the question of whether ``On Wings of Song'' was
by me, and that I should really send a list of things that are running
about in the world disguised, it seems that they aren't clever enough
themselves to separate the wheat from the chaff.'' (Mace, 2013)
\end{quote}
As she never made such a list, we are left to wonder if there are any
other pieces of hers that have been published under her brothers name
and reputation.

This project will use Lieder of Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn. Most of the
available work by Fanny are Lieder, of which Felix also composed a great
deal. We will see if there is a determinable difference in style of
these siblings who grew up very close and received mostly the same
musical education. We will then look at the (disputed?) Op 8 and 9.
Additionally, using Lieder that have been decidedly written by Felix, we
will see if any other of his earlier publications could have potentially
been written by Fanny.
