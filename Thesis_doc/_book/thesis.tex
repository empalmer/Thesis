\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In everyday conversation and music liturature, music is often often
described using subjective summary ``statistics''. For example we talk
about Beethoven's Symphony 9 (think ode to joy) as `majestic',
`powerful', `expertly written', `etc', music critics go more in depth to
talk about the performance and reception, and those with a musical
background might go into more description into the actual music,
couterpoint, melodic arc, etc., compared to the emotional affect.

What if one wanted to compare Beethoven to Bach? One might say that
Beethoven was a classical composer, whereas Bach was a baroque composer.
What exactly to those classifiers mean? Sure, it is very well documented
the years each composer was active in, and that there were large changes
in the popular aspects of classical music. Even the untrained ear can
distinguish differences between Bach and Beethoven. What exactly is the
difference that one can hear? Does Bach follow counterpoint rules more
exactly? What ways can we empirically differentiate those two composers?
How about contemporary composers such as Mozart and Saliery? While those
familiar with classical music can spot the differences between these two
composers, it is more difficult for the untrained ear or eye to spot the
differences.

What if we had a piece and didn't know who wrote it? What features are
inherent in a composers style that would allow us to identify the true
composer?

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

\subsection{Federalist Papers}\label{federalist-papers}

Text classification has recently become a large field. One of the
earliest instances of text classification was on the Federalist
papers.(Mosteller \& Wallace, 1964). The famous Federalist Papers were
written under the pen name `Publius'. There are several disputed papers
attributed to James Madison or Alexander Hamilton. Historians have often
examined the papers using styles of previously known writings of Madison
and Hamilton. () Using the frequency of words such as and `by', `from',
and `upon' Mosteller and Wallace trained the writings on a set of pieces
of each. These unconscious indicators were able to differentiate between
the two writers, and when a model was trained (using \ldots{}. ), the
model was able to identify the author of the disputed paper.

\subsection{Music}\label{music}

Almost any piece by any composer has already been thoroughly examined by
music historians. (Paragraph about things that music historians talk
about when analyzing music. find sources for this. )

The human eye, no matter how well trained in music, has an extremely
hard time noticing small features throughout a piece. Even if one has a
feature in mind, would one want to count the number of times an author
used the word `as' in a 500 page book? Would one trust that count to be
accurate? Say one composer was very fond of middle C, and consistently
used it slightly more than other composers. Unless the use of C was
extreme, likely breaking rules of counterpoint and making odd melodic
and harmonic choices, a human might not be able to catch this
characteristic. Writing has certain rules of grammar, that one would
expect all published writers to mostly follow. Writers would likely
never have the word `as' written twice in a row. Similarly, classical
music has rules and conventions. Counterpoint (described in Chapter 2),
melody, and characteristics of the instrument composed for constrict a
composer.

How can one find similar unconscious features comparable to word
frequency for a composer? There are two main ways to look at features in
a piece of music. The first option is using a recording of the piece.
This way has been used succesfully using a perfomrance in MIDI format to
distinguish certain genres of music. (De Le√≥n \& Inesta, 2003) They used
self-organizing neural maps to classify music as either jazz or
classical.

The second is using the sheet music of the piece. Performances of the
same piece vary extremely, and there is information at a higher
resonlution with easier access (intervals, etc.) in sheet music. Thus,
in this paper sheet music will be used for analysis.

Text analysis, such as in the federalist papers, is read one word after
another. Information in piece of music, however, is read in a variety of
ways. It can be read left to right note by note, but it can also be read
vertically as the harmony, or the notes played together. Also in a piece
with several instruments, the above happens at the same time for each
instrument. There are also aspects that take place over large sections,
such as phrasing, or cadencial patterns. There are rules of counterpoint
that are followed throughout the entire piece. Thus we need to find
`features' or `variables' (see below) that can be measured for each
piece, or perhaps each measure or instrument, that can describe a
certain piece of music. Then we must decide which features are those of
rules and practices of classical music, and where the creativeness and
individuality of a composer happens?

Most of the musical stylometry papers have focused on composers in the
Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical eras. The Mendelssohns were
composing in the Romantic period. This choice might be because composers
in earlier eras had less ``expressive'' allowances for their composing,
thus making features easier, although this is just speculation. There
are also more pieces with doubtful authorship in those eras.

\subsection{Classification}\label{classification}

Assigning likely composers to a piece of music is a classification
problem. Classic approaches to this problem are described in the next
section.

In our case, for each song, we will have vector \(X\) which will be a
vector of all the \(p\) variables and features we are measuring. These
will be the predictors. For each song we will also have, or be trying to
predict \(y\), or the identity of the composer.

\subsection{Background on Variable and Feature
Selection}\label{background-on-variable-and-feature-selection}

Especially in research regarding gene expression and text
categorization, data sets have enormous numbers of variables. We use
``feature'' and ``variable'' interchangably, with the exception when
features are created from variables, and the distinction will be made in
that case. (Guyon \& Elisseeff, 2003). There are several variable
selection algorithms that select the ``important'' variables. If we
included every variable that we extract from the piece, our model would
very likely be overfit.

The start of feature selection is domain knowledge. Thank to John Cox in
the music department for suggesting a list of valuable features. These
will be described in Chapter 2.

Several variable selection algorithms include variable ranking. Variable
ranking uses a score function to assign a score to each possible
variable. It is a computationally efficient method and is robust against
overfitting as it introduces bias but may result in less variance. It is
tempting to only include variables that have a high score. However, this
possibly leads to redundancy. In addition, variables that are not
important by themselves can have a significant performance improvement
when considered with other variables. Popular variable ranking methods
for classification are single variable classfiers and information
theoretic ranking criteria.

Single variable classifiers rank the variable according to thier
individual predictive power. The predictive power can be measured in
terms or error rate, or using the false positive or false negative rate
(fpr, fnr). This classifier cannot distinguish variables that perfectly
seperate the data.

The Information Theoretic Ranking Criteria is used in variable
selection. They often rely on estimates of the mutual information
between the predictor and response, as given by

\[ I(i) = \int_{x_i}\int_yp(x_i,y)\log\frac{p(x_i,y)}{p(x_i)p(y)}dxdy\]

where \(p(x_i)\) and \(p(y)\) are the probability densiites of \(x_i\)
the \(i^th\) predictor and \(y\) the response, and \(p(x_i,y)\) is the
joint density. \(I(i)\) is a measure of dependency between the density
of variable \(x_i\) and the density of the response \(y\) (reword)

After knowing the ranking of a variable we then select which variables
will be useful for our model. This is known as variable subset
selection. The three most common types of variable subset selection are
wrappers, filters, and embedded methods. Filters do not involve any
machine learning to create the criterian for varable subset selection.
Wrappers on the other hand use the ``performance of a learning machine
trained using a given feature subset.'' Embedded methods perform
variable selection in the process of training and are usually specific
to given learning machines

All possible subsets of variables is \(2^p-1\), which for large \(p\) is
often computationally impossible. Strategies like best-first, branch and
bound, simulated anealing, and genetic algorithms can help with the
computational difficulties.

Wrappers are often thought of as brute force methods. This can be good,
as it can reduce overfitting. Two types include forward selection and
backward elimination. These both give nested subsets of variables

Often there is a need for dimensionality reduction. Is there a way to
combine enough of the information given in the features in a smaller
dimensinoal space? This results in feature creationg; using the recorded
variables to create new features to fit the model on.

These include clustering, basic linear tranformations of the input
variables, such as PCa/SVd, and LDA. Also more sophistecated linear
transformas like Fourier and Hadamard.

Two basic goals of these feature creations, are that we can achieve a
good reconstruction of the data. The second is that we can be most
efficeint in making our predictors. The first is an unsupervised
problem. The second is supervised.

Clustering is in fact a type of feature construciton. The group of
clusterd points thereby becomes a feature. Examples of this include
K-means and hierarchical clustering.

SVD, singlar value decomposition is another form of feature
construciton.

\subsection{Previous choices of
features}\label{previous-choices-of-features}

Deciding on and extracting features of music is the first step to
analysis. Depending on the characteristics of the composer and time
period, different features would be useful. Often, features are
extracted en masse and then work is done later to determine which
features are important or useful in identifying style.

In addition to what kinds of features, in music there is also the
question of the scale at where those features take place. They can be
features for a given instruemnt, the entire piece, or each measure. Also
windowing techniques can be used where a ``window'' is created over a
given number of bars or notes, and moves thorugh the whole piece. For
each window, a feature is recorded. These can be overlapping windows by
creating an ``ofset'' of a number of beats or notes. This produces more
data, as instead of one feature for each piece, there is a feature for
each window, and there an be tens of windows in each piece.

Common types of features used before in music analysis are: Frequencies
or fractions of notes, chords, etc are a common low-level feature. These
include the fraction of the score that consisted of dissonant
sororities, as well as the fraction of bars that begin with a dissonant
sonority

Features measuring ``stability'' are also popular. Stability is computed
by dividing the standard deviation of the lengths of the fragment by the
mean length of the fragments. It is normalized in this way to be
comparable over differing time signatures. (Backer \& Kranenburg, 2005)

Markov transition matrices for the rhythms of the pieces, and Markov
transition matrices of the pitches in each piece

The above teqniques were used to analyze the music of Bach, Handel,
Telemann, Mozart and Haydn and compare J.S. Bach, W.F. Bach and J.L
Krebs in an attempt to classify BWV 534.(Backer \& Kranenburg, 2005)
They use overlapping windowing over each entire composition to produce
more data, and avoid issues of dimensionality. They chose a window of 30
bars to create a high enough number of fragments per piece and a low
enough variance of the feature values between fragments. They chose to
extract 20 features including features of freactions and measuring
stability, and entropy.

Aditionally, a number of previous papers have focused on Josquin des
Prez. This is likely due to the fact that there is a large training and
testing data set available in easily analyzable format provided by the
Josquin Research Project (citation). In addition there are a number of
pieces of disputed authorship that have been attributed to him. Work by
Brinkman et al. (Brinkman, Shanahan, \& Sapp, n.d.) use machine learning
approaches to evaluate attribution of compositions by des Prez. They
used both high level and low level features. The high level features
were 9-8 suspensions, oblique motion, contrary motion, similar motion
and parallel motion. The low level features were average melodic
entropy, normalized pairwise variability index (?), and note-to-note
transition probabilities.

Work by Speiser and Gupta (Speiser \& Gupta, n.d.) analyzed Josquin and
his contemporaries to attempt to classify unknown works. They extracted
four categories of features, frequencies of individual notes,
frequencies of pairwise interval combinations between each of the
voices, Markov transition matrices for the rhythms of the pieces, and
Markov transition matrices of the pitches in each piece. In total, this
lead to a total of 3000 features.

\subsection{Previous applications}\label{previous-applications}

Most of the previous research has needed to do some kind of feature
selection. A lot of features are extracted as a priori we don't know
which features are distinguishing.

A modification of a forward selection (Floating Forward Selection(cite))
was used to extract features in order to identify distinguishing style
between Bach, Handel, Telemann, Mozart, and Haydn, and then subsequently
classify the authorship of BWV 535. (Backer \& Kranenburg, 2005) Each
composer was compared via creating comparisons of all possible class
arrangements, ie (Bach)(Handel), (Bach)(Handel,Teleman), etc. The
algorithm extracted features for each class arrangement that
distinguished the groups the best. A decision boundry was used for Bach
and not Bach, on the features Diss Part, Par thirds, and stab time
slice. A k-nearest neibors classifier was successful in comparing Bach
and others as well as each individual composer. Decision trees to
interpret the features used in decision making of the different class
arrangements. To determine authorship of BWV 535, they train a quadratic
Bayesian classifier to distinguish J.S. Bach, W.F. Bach and J.L Krebs.
They again compare every possible class arrangement as potential
composers.

PCA was used to analyze the music of Bach, Handel, Telemann, Mozart and
Haydn and compare J.S. Bach, W.F. Bach and J.L Krebs in an attempt to
classify BWV 534.(Backer \& Kranenburg, 2005) Although only two PC's
accounted for most of the variance, 5 PCs were used to account for more
variance. Binary comparisions were used to compare composers. This
resulted in a relatively clear separation between Bach and Josquin. For
Josquin and his contemporaries, the PC's do not do as well a job of
separation. The results of the principal component analysis run on all
the composers, were used to train a classifier on all the composers.
First a k-nearest neighbor classifier was used. To accound for most of
the variance, 27 PCs were used. Next they trained a support vector
machine classifier with a radial kernel. Finally they used a decision
tree to determine which features were important in discerning the
composers.

Speiser and Gupta (Speiser \& Gupta, n.d.) scored each feature by the
mutual information of each features. They then chose the top 50 features
and ran GDA. They then ran PCA to attempt to remove some of the
dependencies associated with musical features. They first fit a Naive
Bayes for classification, but it had a large training error as the
independence assumption does not work well with musical data. Next they
used support vector machines with a Gaussian kernel and GCA learning
algorithms.

\section{Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn}\label{fanny-and-felix-mendelssohn}

Most musical stylometry analysis focuses on music of the Renaissance and
Baroque period, as there are more questions of authorship in that
period. As the Romantic period is much more modern in comparison, there
are many more surviving records of original manuscripts that include the
composer.

Felix Mendelssohn, often considered a prodigy akin to Mozart, was a
prolific composer. Before he was fourteen years old, he had already
written over 100 compositions.

His lesser known sister Fanny Hensel was also a composer of incredible
skill. The two were very close, for many years training and studying
together. In their early education living in Berlin, Felix and Fanny
received the same musical education, first piano lessons by Madam Bigot,
a famous pianist esteemed by Haydn and Beethoven. Beginning in 1818,
Carl Friedrich Zelter, a somewhat removed student of Bach and the most
influential Berlin musician of the time, began to teach them both
composition. In addition to music, the children were tutored by some of
the finest scholars in Berlin in subjects such as languages, history,
and drawing. Goethe himself claimed that Fanny was ``as gifted as
Felix''. (Tillard, 1996)

As Fanny grew up, her father started implying that she should focus her
energy on the domestic sphere of her life. While the fact that she never
became a world famous composer and performer is often attributed to the
gender politics of her time, it is also likely due to her high class.
(Reich, 1991) Especially considering the anti-semetic feelings of the
time, and since the family had recently converted from Judaism to
Christianity, the family did not want any other unusual characteristic
such as a professional female composer to set them further apart from
``polite'' society.

Most of Fanny's available work are Lieder, short pieces of voice
accompanied by piano. They were accepted at the time as the more
feminine, domestic compositions, acceptable for women to compose. Her
brother moved on to more elaborate compositions such as operas and
orchestral concertos. Her father pressured Fanny to remain composing
Lider. (Todd, 2003)
\begin{quote}
``Music will perhaps become his profession, while for you it can and
must only be an ornament, never the root of your being and doing. We may
therefore pardon him some ambition and desire to be acknowledged in a
pursuit which appears very important to him,\ldots{} while it does you
credit that you have always shown yourself good and sensible in these
matters; \ldots{} Remain true to these sentiments and to this line of
conduct; they are feminine, and only what is truly feminine is an
ornament to your sex.''
\end{quote}
Throughout their lives, Felix and Fanny maintained contact through
letters until Fanny's death in 1847 and Felix's death shortly
thereafter. These letters contain many instances of Felix asking for
advice on his compositions (include quote)

Unlike Felix who conducted and performed piano and organ in some of
Berlin's most esteemed concert halls, most of Fanny's performances were
private, only performed in small circles of her friends and family at
intimate parties. Similarly, although she was quite a prolific composer,
under recommendation of her father Abraham Mendelssohn, and to a lesser
extent Felix, Fanny did not publish her work until later in her life. In
1846 after her fathers death and though her brothers disapproval, she
published her first collection of Lieder. Many of Fanny's unpublished
notebooks are in private collections and are inaccessible

However, it is widely speculated (known?) that some of Fanny's work was
published under her brother's name, Especially three pieces each in his
Op 8 and 9 lieder. Famously, when Felix met the Queen of England, she
sang Felix's Lied ``Italien'', and Felix had to admit that in fact, it
was his sister that had written it. In a letter to Felix, Fanny admits:
\begin{quote}
``I have just recently received a letter from Vienna, which contained
basically nothing but the question of whether ``On Wings of Song'' was
by me, and that I should really send a list of things that are running
about in the world disguised, it seems that they aren't clever enough
themselves to separate the wheat from the chaff.'' (Mace, 2013)
\end{quote}
As she never made such a list, we are left to wonder if there are any
other pieces of hers that have been published under her brothers name
and reputation.

This project will use Lieder of Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn. Most of the
available work by Fanny are Lieder, of which Felix also composed a great
deal. We will see if there is a determinable difference in style of
these siblings who grew up very close and received mostly the same
musical education. We will then look at the (disputed?) Op 8 and 9.
Additionally, using Lieder that have been decidedly written by Felix, we
will see if any other of his earlier publications could have potentially
been written by Fanny.

\subsection{Optical music recognition}\label{optical-music-recognition}

Sheet music as a form of data requires a lengthy process of conversion
before being able to be used in any analysis. Simply scanning the scores
into, say, a PDF, gives no musical semantics and can only be viewed on
screen or printed on paper. Thus, the two main steps in reading in data
from sheet music are: using optical music recognition software to
transform physical scores into digital formats. The second step is to
read the digital format in to R.

The scores used in this paper were obtained from physical copies
available in the Reed music library. These scores were then scanned
using software designed for optical music recognition (OMR). This method
requires learning from graphical and textual information. The main
things the software must pick up are the locations of bar lines, notes
and rests, slurs, dynamic and tempo markings, lyrics etc. Basic optical
music recognition has been around since 1966. Most commonly, the first
step in optical music recognition is to remove the staff lines. The
staff lines are critical, as they define the basis for the vertical
definition distance of pitch, and the horizontal distance definition of
rhythm. The staff gives a normalization that is helpful, essentially
defining the size of what notes and Rhythm will look like. Staff removal
methods include projections, histograms, run lengths, Candidates
assemblage, contour tracking, and Graph path search. - which i don't
understand and may not write about \ldots{} - ({\textbf{???}}) The next
step is music symbol extraction and classification. These methods
include template matching, where the object in question is compared to
existing known musical symbols, simple operators, such as analysis of
bounding boxes and projections, joining graphical primatives, such as
combining extracted objects such as notes, note heads, and note beams to
connect them in a musically correct way to form chords etc. Other
methods use statistical models for analyzing musical primitives (the
objects its trying to classify) such as Neural Networks, Support Vector
Machines, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Hidden Markov Models.

The next step is syntactical analysis and validation. This step
essentially uses defined grammars describing the organization of music
notation in terms of music symbols. This makes the classification
problem simpler, as there are existing rules and relationships between
musical symbols.

insert picture of MuseScore score

The OMR used in this paper was PhotoScore. Photoscore outputs a musicXML
file that can be read in by most music composing software, such as
Sibelius, Finale or MuseScore. Muse score is a free software and was
used in this paper. After being read into MuseScore, each piece was
proof-read and corrected, as there were often errors in the OMR,
especially in recognizing triplets.

MusicXML on its own is not conducive to converting into a data frame as
representing the single note middle c looks like this:

MusicXML is used commonly as it is conducive to representing sheet music
and music notation, and it can be transferable to many different music
softwares. We then need to convert into a format more easily readable
into R. We do this by using Humdrum's function xml2hum that converts a
musicXML file into a .krn file. This file time can be read much more
easily into R. Compared to above, the code for a single middle c whole
note would be :
\begin{verbatim}
**kern
*clefG2
*k[c]
*M4/4
=1-
1c/
\end{verbatim}
The import\_xml\_files.sh file goes through the process of converting
scores from musicXML to .krn. The files need to be separated into having
a separate file for each staff, which would mean a seperate file for
each instrument. In our case for each piece there are always two or
three files for each piece, which are voice, piano right hand, and piano
left hand. This is necessary to avoid the bugs in xml2hum that have
issues when staffs don't necessarily match up as a result of the
conversion process, most often by rhythm.

\subsection{.krn to R}\label{krn-to-r}

Once we have .krn files to represent each piece (usually 2 or 3 files),
we use regular expressions to extract key information.

\section{Raw data frame:}\label{raw-data-frame}

The data frame representing one piece: Each instrument contains the
following columns: rhythm value {[}4{]}, rhythm name {[}quarter note{]},
note value {[}5{]}, note name (octave inclusive){[}cc{]}, note name
(octave exclusive){[} C sharp{]}

Additional column values are measure.

Each row of the data frame contains one time base value. For a given
piece, the time base represents the shortest note duration value. For
example, if the shortest note a piece contained was a sixteenth note,
the time base would be 16. Each measure then would contain 16 rows.

\section{About the functions - Feature creation - liley some musical
infromattion}\label{about-the-functions---feature-creation---liley-some-musical-infromattion}

Once the scores are converted into R raw data, feature creation begins.
These features are mostly features suggested by John Cox.

\section{Feature Selection}\label{feature-selection}

Next they computed the entropy of the probability of occurrence of ways
of thinking about chords; chords are the same no matter what scale
degree they are on, and distinguishing chords differently. Next the
entropy was calculated given the probability of each pitch in the score.
Entropy was calculated by \(-\sum_{i = 1}^{N}p_i\log{p_i}\) where
\(p_i\) is the probability of occurrence, and \(N\) is the total
number.Next they the average number of active voices at one time. This
represents the voice density of the piece. Then for every interval, the
duration of that interval was divided by the total duration of all
intervals. Next the total duration of parallel thirds, fourths, and
sixths divided by the total duration of all intervals was measured.
Finally a measure of suspensions was found. (Backer)

\textbf{More info}

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter
title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are
to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's
obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add
an indent there.
