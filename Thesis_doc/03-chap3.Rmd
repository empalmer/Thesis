# MuseR and features

To the best of my knowledge, there is currently no package in R that has been built to analyze sheet music. There are existing packages (such as tuneR) that examine audio formats of music. The intention of this thesis was to create a package, museR, that imports sheet music in the proper form (musicXML or Kern) and does all of the analysis using R. 

## Importing data into R

MuseR is equipped to import data in the Kern format. The functions for converting these files are `kern2df()` and `piece_df()`. These are most usefully in the form of individual splines. This allows for naming the columns according to instrument. Figure 3.1 shows short example piece appearing as it would look from MuseScore.

This piece would have the Kern format representation as shown in Figure 3.2.

Using museR's `piece_df()` function to create the following data frame.

Data in R are commonly expressed as data frames. Music as a data structure is very rugged. Expressing music as a data frame has challenges, as music cannot be easily expressed in rectangular form. When expressing it in rectangular form,  placeholder or padding entries must be added to account for the nonrectangularness. MuseR's `piece_df()` works by using regular expressions to extract note and rhythm information. It uses NA and . values to indicate empty spaces and duration respectively.

<!--
The output from `piece_df()` follows the same ideas as the structure of kern files. It has "." values similar to the Kern dots that represent the duration of the note for the time base. This kind structure is good for certain types of features, where we are interested only in the type of note happening, the time of the attack of the note, or without considering rhythm. Sometimes, we are interested in how long the note lasts. The `durration_df()` function corrects this issue. It converts the `NA`s representing duration and replaces them with the note value that is currently happening. This allows for analysis that considers duration. The below figure represents the durational version of the above data frame.

## Features currently supported in museR

#### Melodic intervals

Melodic intervals, or the interval between two successive notes, are found using the `mel_ints()` function. It is currently only equipped to look at melodic intervals for the top note of each staff. In this context, it is most commonly used for analyzing melodic intervals of the voice. The function first extracts the top line of any instrument, and then outputs the proportion of each melodic interval happening over the whole piece. There are 12 possible intervals that are counted (ignoring augmented and diminished): unison, m2, M2, m3, M3, p4, tt, p5, m6, M6, m7, M7. `mel_ints()` outputs a vector of the proportion of each of the intervals. 

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale = .5]{images/ex2.png}
\caption{Example of calculating proportion of melodic intervals}
\label{subd}
\end{figure}

For example if this function was run on the above piece, the melodic top line intervals would be: $\{(f,c),(c,d),(d,f)\} = \{p4,M2,m3\}$, which would output the proportion vector $(0,1/3,1/3,0,0,1/3,0,0,0,0,0,0)$.

If we are interested in the types of melodic intervals, we can use `consonance()` to examine the proportion of consonant (perfect, imperfect, dissonant) intervals over the piece. This function works by calling `mel_ints()` and then adding up the perfect, imperfect, and dissonant intervals proportions. 

#### Density

The `beat_density()` function analyzes the average and standard deviation of density of each measure in the piece. The function is named "beat" density as it only accounts for the instance a note starts. For example if a measure consisted of a single whole note it would be only counted once even though it is voiced the entire measure. 

In the above example, the first measure would have a beat density of 4, and the second measure would have a beat density of 2. 

#### Major_minor

For most musical analysis, the key of the piece is important in determining chords, etc. The key is based on the key signature, which is always given in a Kern file. Kern files from CCARH have the key of the piece given, but scanned files do not. 
For kern files from CCARH, `Major_minor()` extracts the key given by the Kern file. for scanned files, `Major_minor()` identifies the two options for key given the key signature. For example, if there was a key signature with one sharp, the options would be G Major or E minor. The tonic for each option is identified, and then the count of instances of both choices for tonic is made. The key is determined by which of the options for tonic has the higher count.

#### Scale degree frequencies

Once the key of a piece is determined, the proportion of each scale degree is calculated. The scale degrees consist of: Tonic, Supertonic, Mediant, Submediant, Dominant, Submediant, and Leading tone. In the example above, if we assume the key is F major, the tonic has a tonic scale degree proportion of 2/6, the mediant 1/6, dominant, 1/6, submediant, 2/6.


<!--
#### Chords

Suspended chords are currently not supported by MuseR. Chords that begin, or are "attacked" at the same time count. 

First, the key of the piece is found, as different chords depend on the key. Next, the times notes are played at the same time are extracted into a list. Then the number of unique notes played at once is found. If there are two notes played at once, `harm_int()` calculates the harmonic interval. This is done by calculating $$note_1 - note_2 \mod(12)$$ This gives the number of half steps between each note. That number is then matched with the index of the interval. Work is being done to have this include augmented and diminished interval, but unfortunately that has not been completed at this time. 

The possible triad chords are all defined by the intervals between each note. For example, a Major triad is given by the base note, a major third above the base, and a perfect fifth above the base. This corresponds to 4 half steps then 4 half steps. Alternatively a minor triad is given by the base, a minor third above, and a perfect fifth above the base, which is 3 half steps, then 5 half steps. 

A similar process is done for seventh chords.

#### Frequency of rhythm use

We determine the frequency using `rhythm_freq()` to find the most common types of rhythm: half notes, dotted half notes, quarter notes, dotted quarter notes, eighth notes, dotted eight notes, sixteenth notes, and thirty second notes.  

#### Length

We use `length_measures()` as a feature for the length of a piece. It is calculated by finding how many measures the piece has. 

<!--
#### Voice distance

The voice distance for each piece is measured as the range of the singer, which is the distance in half steps between the lowest note the singer sings and the hightest. 

#### Piano distance

Piano distance is the maximum distance between the lowest note in a chord and the highest. Composers with different hand size could possibly have different comfortable chords to play.
