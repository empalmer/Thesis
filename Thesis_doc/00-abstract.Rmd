Classification for authorship of written classical music is a relatively infrequently explored field. In theory, composers leave behind unconsious (or perhaps consious) signals that indicate a piece of music as thier own. Ideally these signals or features can be extracted and used to build a model to predict the composer of a piece of music. For instance, the siblings Fanny Hensel and Felix Mendelssohn, although very similar in compositional style, likely have features that distingush their music. It is speculated that there are at least six pieces that Fanny wrote that were published by Felix. Low level features, including frequencies of chords and scale degree usage were extracted from 31 lieder known to be written by Felix and 35 pieces known to be written by Fanny. These features were extracted using museR, an R package written by me*. Additionally, to check the validity of the model, 27 solo piano pieces from J.S. Bach's Well Tempered Clavier were used to compare against Felix and Fanny. A logistic lasso, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, naive Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis were preformed. Comparing between Bach and Menelssohn, --- model resulted in the lowest misclassification rate. Between Felix and Fanny --- model resulted in the lowest misclassification rate.  Finally the six disputed pieces were run through the models. and ...
