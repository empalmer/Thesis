Classification for authorship of written classical music is a relatively infrequently explored field. In theory, composers leave behind unconscious (or perhaps conscious) signals that indicate a piece of music as their own. Ideally these signals or features can be extracted and used to build a model to predict the composer of a piece of music. For instance, the siblings Fanny Hensel and Felix Mendelssohn, although very similar in compositional style, likely have features that distinguish their music. It is speculated that there are at least six pieces that Fanny wrote that were published by Felix. 

Low level features, including frequencies of chords and scale degrees were extracted from 31 lieder known to be written by Felix and 35 pieces known to be written by Fanny. These features were extracted using museR, an R package written by me*. Additionally, to check the validity of features used, 27 solo piano pieces from J.S. Bach's Well Tempered Clavier were used. A logistic lasso, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, naive Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis were performed on the feature space in order to classify the pieces. In addition, those same models were fit on the principal components. Comparing between Bach and Mendelssohn, the LDA model fit on the principalmodel resulted in the lowest misclassification rate (0.049). Between Felix and Fanny a logistic lasso  model on the principal components resulted in the lowest misclassification rate.  Finally the six disputed pieces were run through the models. As misclassification rates were so high on the models, we cannot trust the predictions for these disputed pieces.
