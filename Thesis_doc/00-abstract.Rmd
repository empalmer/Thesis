Classification for authorship of written classical music is a relatively infrequently explored field. In theory composers leave behind unconsious (or perhaps consious) signals that indicate a piece of music as thier own. Ideally these signals, or features can be extracted and used to build a model to predict the composer of a piece of music. For instance the siblings Fanny Hensel and Felix Mendelssohn, although very similar in compositional style, likely have featuresthat distingush their music. It is speculated that there are at least ... pieces that Fanny wrote that were published by Felix. Low level features, including frequencies of chords and scale degree usage were extracted from ... pieces known to be written by Felix and ... pieces known to be written by Fanny. These features were extracted using museR, an R package written by me*. Additionally, to check the validity of the model, pieces from J.S. Bach's Well Tempered Clavier were used to compare against Felix and Fanny. A lasso logistic model was then trained on Bach and Mendelsssohn data using 5-fold cross validation with a missclassification rate of ... . A lasso logistic model was then trained in the same way on Felix and Fanny data with a missclassification rate of ... Finally the 12 disputed pieces were checked and ...
