### Research Log

Thesis mtg: 

* Working on coding muse data in R - is there a better way to do this? 
* Much of the muse data seems like it will be unnesecary for analysis. I think I only need the first four collumns


This week I:

* Read about Muse Data
* Installed and read about Humdrum
* Started figuring out how to use Humdrum
* Decided its better to make my own R script
* Worked on getting my script running - in progress 




To do for next week!: 
*
