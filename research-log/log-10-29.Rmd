Find data: 6 disputed leider, 15 Fanny , 30 Felix
Import data to R
Get humdrum/xml2hum running. 


Comments: 

xml2hum seems to be working now! 

I have not been able to find that much sheet music by Fanny that would be able to be converted into music XML. I'm thinking I might have to enter it myself into musescore. Honestly it shouldn't be that hard if I use the PAB keyboards. (Hopefully). I am meeting with the music librarian on ___ and hopefully they will be able to find more scores!

I have found sheet music (in pdf form) that should work for my data set.
