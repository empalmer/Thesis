### Thesis mtg: 



### Data process. 
Download Musescore file
Open it in musescore and export to xml
Try xml2hum directly. Usually doesnt work. 
Extract each line individually using the command 
xml2hum -s1 file.xml > staff1.krn
xml2hum -s2 file.xml > staff2.krn

Check each has right number of notes rcheck staff1.krn | grep = | tail -5 (first had to install rcheck by going into folder and doing make rcheck)

Check all have same base rythm (also make minrhy)
minrhy staff1.krn staff2.krn

Change if nesecary and compile
timebase -t 48 staff1.krn > x1.krn
    timebase -t 48 staff2.krn > x2.krn
    assemble x2.krn x1.krn | rid -d > score.krn

I'm thinking of getting rid of text in the file. It seems unesecary. Also get rid of other score compiling data. 
extract -i '**text' s1.krn > ts1.krn

### Comments
It takes awhile to get the scores in the nice format. The process is not automated. Advice? 
The title and other info does not get translated as easily. 


It sounds like the PARC has the ability to convert scores into musicXML! Joe has given my contact to the person in the parc that knows how to do that. 

Working on getting pieces I have (list of pieces) into R. Even though I have the xml2hum program working, it seems it only works for one line at a time, and then I have to add them together and make sure it worked. 

Another piece for comparison?

### To do next week:

Data:
A ton of data cleaning
Get ahold of instructional technologist at PARC and convert all scores to XML
Clean this data and import into R
Figure out bash scripts or make files for data extraction. 

Writing:
Start writing about existing lit and the Mendelssohns
Question: How in depth should I go about the process? For example, should I say, convert data from XML to R. Or should I go through each step and issues doing so? 

Analysis: 
Figure out what features I want to extract
Code in R those features
OR see if humdrum can do it nicer
