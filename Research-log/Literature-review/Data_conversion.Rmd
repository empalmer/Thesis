## Data converstion

Each score in print form was scanned using Photoscore. This process produced a file in xml format. 

Using MuseScore, each file was checked for errors manually. There were often ... per file, often accidentals or rests erros. 

Converting to *kern: 

All lyrics and other informatino were removed as they are not used in this analysis.
