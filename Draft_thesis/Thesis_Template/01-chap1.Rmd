# Introduction

Music often has subjective summary "statistics" throughout music literature and everyday conversation. For example we talk about Beethovens Symphony 9 (think ode to joy) as "magestic, powerful fateful, expertly writtin, etc", music critics go more in depth to say.... , and those with a musical background might go into more description into the actual music compared to the emotional affect. 

What if one wanted to compare Beethoven to say, Bach? One might say that Beethoven was a classical composer, whereas Bach was a baroque composer. What exactly to those classifiers mean? Sure, it is very well documented the years each composer was active in, and that there were large changes in the popular aspects of classical music. Even the untrained ear can distinguish differences between Bach and Beethoven. What exactly is the difference that one can hear? Does Bach follow counterpoint rules more exactly? What ways can we empirically differentiate those two composers? How about Mozart and Saliery? While those familiar with classical music can spot the differences between the two composers, it is more difficult for the untrained ear or eye to spot the differences. 

What if we had a piece and didnt know who wrote it?

### Music

Analyzing music, almost any piece by any composer, has already been throughouly examined my music historians. (Paragraph about things that music historians talk about when analyzing music.)



The human eye, no matter how well trained in music, has an extremetly hard time identifying small features throughout a piece. Say one composer was very fond of middle C, and consitently used it slightly more than other composers. Unless the use of C was extreme, breaking rules of counterpoint, a human might not be able to catch this characteristic. Writing has certain rules of grammar, that one would expect all published writers to mostly follow. Writers would likely never have the word and written twice in a row. Similarly, classical music has rules and conventions. Counterpoint (described in Chapter 2), melody, and characteristics of the instrument composed for etc constrict a composer. 

How can one find similar unconcious feature comparable to and/the usage for a composer?  Some () have analyzed these features in auditory format (Midi)... In this paper we look at music in sheet music form. We then come to an interesting problem. Writing such as in the federalist papers is one word then the next, read left to right line by line, one word at a time. However music
